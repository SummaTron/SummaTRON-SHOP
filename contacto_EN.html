		<b>SummaTRON</b> is a project of SummaData, SLU.<br> <br>
		<b> SummaTRON-SHOP </b> is a MarketPlace for eBooks in NFT format, each eBook is individually minted associated with the TRC71 Token, SummaeBook (EBKNFT).
		<br><br>
		Each NFT has a json file associated with it where it is linked to the ebook. All these files are stored in BTFs (Bit Torrent File System)
		<br><br>
		We have to automate the process of selling the NFTs, meanwhile in the Shop menu you can choose one of the books, send 0.1 TRON to the address TKwtYQe4HfkjBe4yjiHdQamp8oRnNTgZXe,
		and to the paying address we will send the NFT of the chosen book. When you receive it, we trust that you will send us the price of the NFT which is 10 TRON.
		<br> <br>
		For now we coin each NFT one by one. The value of the NFTs is in the content and in its novelty, WE ARE CREATING the future.
		<br> <br>
		If you want to set up your own MarketPlace or create your own NFTs, we can help you. Get in touch with us.		
		<br> <br>
		If you have any questions about the project you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@summatron.com"><b>info@summatron.com</b></a>.

					<p style="text-align:justify">	
					NFT stands for "non-fungible token," and it can technically contain anything digital, including pictures, animated GIFs, songs, video game items, or ebooks.
					An NFT can be unique, like a real life painting, or a copy of many, like trading cards,
					but the blockchain keeps track of who owns the file.
					An NFT needs to be stored on a blockchain, and the best is <b> TRON.NETWORK </b>

				<h5 class="card-header">Why TRON?</h5>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
					Currently, a large amount of user information and Internet traffic is concentrated in some corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Snapchat. <b> TRON </b> attempts to mitigate this control by granting ownership of the returned information to its creators. for or
					<b> TRON </b> is an open and decentralized platform, and distributed storage technology will allow digital content creators to cut out intermediaries like the Apple Store and Google Play. In this way, content producers obtain their profits directly from consumers, without intermediaries. for
					for
					<br> Electronic books, music, photos, articles, etc. They can be easily marketed without intermediaries to make the payment. for
					for
					Banks, Visa, Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc. they take a large part of the amount of operations, basically because until now there was no alternative. for
					for
					Transactions made in TRON are traceable, through <a href="http://tronscan.org" target="_blank"> Tronscan.org </a>, the 2 participants in the purchase / sale can see the result of the operation. for
					for
					This functionality replaces the need to contact your bank or Visa, when a transaction is "lost". But it doesn't replace would-be scammers, <b> TRON </b> improves technology, not people's morals.

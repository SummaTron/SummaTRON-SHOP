# SummaTRON-SHOP
The goal is that users who have a digital product they want to sell do not need intermediaries like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc., but directly they can insert them in SummaTRON-SHOP, put a price on TRX and you directly get the ingResos your sales to your TRON account.
The elimination of intermediary will increase the benefits of the users that so far they shared most of the income with the intermediary companies.
The existence of the intermediary companies makes sense when the product is a physical element, since they are generally the ones in charge of carrying out the distribution of the product and all the logistics that it entails.
When it comes to digital products the whole process can be done directly between the creator and the client. There is only the problem of payment, which is currently resolved by payment gateways with banks, credit cards, or Paypal. In general all these companies take a percentage of the sale, along with the percentage that takes the platform of sale.
SummaTRON-SHOP proposes a system where the platform It only manages the list of products, but all the support is in Tron. Network, the purchase is made directly by the customer paying by TRX the product and automatically download it to your computer.
Logically the type of digital products have to be of the type: Ebook, music, videos, drawings, etc. As long as they can be digitally uploaded and downloaded. 

The operation of SummaTRON-SHOP is√° Based on 3 processes:
1)	The insert of a product
2)	The sale of products
3)	The modification of products

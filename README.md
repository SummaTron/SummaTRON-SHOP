# SummaTRON-SHOP
SummaTRON-SHOP is a MarketPlace based on BTFS, NFT and conected with TronLink. The goal is that users who have a digital product they want to sell do not need intermediaries like Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc., but directly they can insert them in SummaTRON-SHOP, using a NFT token, put them a price on TRX and directly get the incomes for sales to your TRON account. <br>
SummaTRON-SHOP uses a TRC721 token: SummaeBook (EBKNFT), there are several EBKNFT minted, and you can view them thrue the option "View" at www.summatron.com. In the future the wallet could access to wallet and show all the NFT: images, ebook, audio, video, etc. The owner of NFT tokens can view or sell thens, all in the Tron Ecosystem. 
<br><br>
The elimination of intermediary will increase the benefits of the users that so far they shared most of the income with the intermediary companies.
<br><br>
The existence of the intermediary companies makes sense when the product is a physical element, since they are generally the ones in charge of carrying out the distribution of the product and all the logistics that it entails.
<br><br>
When it comes to digital products the whole process can be done directly between the creator and the client. There is only the problem of payment, which is currently resolved by payment gateways with banks, credit cards, or Paypal. In general all these companies take a percentage of the sale, along with the percentage that takes the platform of sale.
<br><br>
SummaTRON-SHOP proposes a system where the platform It only manages the list of products, but all the support is in Tron. Network, the purchase is made directly by the customer paying by TRX the product and automatically download it to your computer.
<br><br>
Logically the type of digital products have to be of the type: Ebook, music, videos, drawings, etc. As long as they can be digitally uploaded and downloaded. 
<br><br>
The operation of SummaTRON-SHOP is based on 4 processes:
1)	The insert of a product
2)	The sale of products
